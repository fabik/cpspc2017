\heading{Task}

You are given a set of $n$ integers. We split this set into $k$ disjoint subsets, for every subset compute the greatest common divisor of its elements, and sum all the subsets' GCDs.

For every $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ determine the maximal sum which can be obtained this way.

\heading{Input}

In the first line of input there is a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200\,000$) -- the cardinality of the set. In the second line, there are $n$ pairwise distinct positive integers, not exceeding $10^{18}$.

\heading{Output}

Output a single line containing $n$ integers -- the best sum of GCDs when partitioning into $1$, $2$, \ldots, $n$ subsets.
