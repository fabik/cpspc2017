CPSPC 2017 Plans
================

Day CZ
------

  * **police** - (graph) find vertices in directed graph from which all other vertices can be reached
  * **pyramid** - (binary search, inclusionâ€“exclusion) find k-th lowest number which is divisible by at least one number from a set
  * **race** - (dp, divide and conquer, bitmasks) given a maze, determine for each query whether it is possible to get from field X to field Y using a sequence of steps right or down

Day PL
------
  * **gcds** - (number theory, greedy) given a set A of n numbers, for every k = 1, 2,..., n split A into k subsets to maximize the sum of gcd's of all the subsets
  * **power** - (geometry, graphs) colour a given set of points on the plane with two colours, maximizing the distance of the closest points of the same colour
  * **brackets** - (graphs, paths) in a graph having edges labeled with brackets (){}[] find a shortest path between two given vertices, which is a valid bracket expression
  
Day SK
------

* * **skiing(svk)** - (geometry) for N parallel line segments and points A, B, find shortest polygonal chain from A to B intersecting all segments in given order
  * **counterspells** - (trees, heavy-light decomposition) we build a tree vertex-by-vertex, keeping it colored in a specific way. After each node addition, compute number of vertices that need to change color
  * **password** - (strings) you are given a string S of form ABC, where C and A differ in exactly one character. Find all possible lengths of AB

Day MIX
-------

  * **secret** - (graph, divide and conquer) determine whether a path between two given points exists in a compressed image
  * **descendants** - (trees) for two trees built on the same set of vertices, for every vertex determine the number of other vertices that are its descendants in both trees
  * **posters** - (geometry, sweepline) for set S of disjoint rectangles, compute intersection areas of S with query rectangles
